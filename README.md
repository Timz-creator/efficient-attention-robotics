Benchmarking attention mechanisms for real-time projectile tracking on embedded systems

# Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Embedded Robotics

## Overview
Comparing attention mechanisms (Standard, Flash, Multi-Query) for real-time projectile tracking on resource-constrained hardware.

## Goal
Find the optimal attention mechanism for autonomous evasion systems for ground robots and drones.

## Metrics
- Inference speed (FPS)
- Memory usage
- Tracking accuracy
- Power consumption (simulated)


## Daily Log
### Day 1
